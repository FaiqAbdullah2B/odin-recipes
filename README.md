I will be building a basic recipe website my current knowledge of HTML.

I will be building the basic webpage Boilerplate and structure.

The website would contain images, links to other web pages and lists.

Since I'm only experienced with HTML but not CSS or JS yet, the website won't look that pretty,

but I'll make sure to do the best I can.
