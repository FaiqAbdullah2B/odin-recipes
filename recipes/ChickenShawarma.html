    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Awesome Lebanese sandwich served in most Lebanese restaurants. Can be served with Tahini sauce or Toum.</p>
    <p> Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. <br>
        It’s a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats, <br>
        that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as it rotates. <br>
        But don’t worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old 
        pan or on the BBQ!
